	"Security-minded full-stack dev. I compete in CTFs and hackathons, love web exploitation and blockchain challenges, and study smart-contract audits. I still take classic full-stack freelance, shipping fast and modern web apps that solve real problems while applying the same discipline to securing the web. Iâ€™m naturally a curious person and love learning something new";
